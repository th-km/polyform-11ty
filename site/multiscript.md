We design custom typefaces, lettering, and logotypes with a special focus on Latin and Chinese scripts, covering languages across the Americas, Western and Central Europe, and China. Our approach connects the two cultures through design, history, and technology. Our expertise in both writing systems allows for a good dialogue between the two cultures, and enables us to design the best solution for each project.
