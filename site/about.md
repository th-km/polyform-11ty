Polyform is a bi-scriptual type and communication design studio that designs, develops and applies typography at all scales.

We work in close collaboration with type foundries, agencies, and brands. Together we connect two cultures through design, history and technology.

We are a small, multidisciplinary team, and our studio grows to accomplish bigger projects. We regularly collaborate with a team of experts from a wide range of specialties. Our network includes type designers, graphic designers, artists, font engineers, researchers, teachers, graphic designers, and developers.
